## Haskell Platform ##
To run Haskell programs on your computer, you will need to download the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).

After downloading, go to PowerShell and type `ghci`. It should display the GHCi version, and on pressing enter, `Prelude>`.

To run the source code file `factorial.hs`, type in `:load factorial.hs` in front of `Prelude>`. Hopefully it compiles without errors!

## Functional Programming in Haskell ##

University of Glasgow has a great course on Future Learn: [Functional Programming in Haskell: Supercharge Your Coding](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/functional-programming-haskell).

Do you want to develop software using the latest programming language paradigm? Haskell is a functional programming language, based on formal mathematical principles. As such, it is easy to reason about and develop, and it executes efficiently on modern multicore machines. From investment banks to social networks, everyone is adopting Haskell.

On this introductory course, you will discover the power, elegance and simplicity of functional programming in Haskell. By the end, you will be able to:
- characterise the differences between imperative and functional programming paradigms;
- implement small-scale functional programs in elementary Haskell;
- apply standard combinators for operating on lists;
- create new algebraic data types and use recursion to define functions that traverse recursive types; and reason in a mathematical manner about data types, functions, recursion and similar functional constructs.

This course has been created by the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow – the virtual birthplace of the Haskell language, where many of its original developers worked. It will give you the opportunity to learn with these experts and join the growing, global community of Haskell programmers. What topics will you cover?

- Evaluation via expression reduction
- Semantics of function abstraction and application
- Operations involving basic types including integers, characters and booleans
- Definition and traversal of recursive data types including lists and trees
- Techniques for structuring programs of non-trivial size
- Developing custom parsing tools with library support
- Automated testing with the QuickCheck tool
- Infinite data structures and lazy evaluation
- Type classes
- Principles of Lambda calculus
- Monads

By the end of the course, you‘ll be able to...

- Develop simple programs involving basic Haskell techniques, including pure function definitions
- Interpret data structures and function interfaces using types
- Develop, modify, and explore code using standard Haskell platform tools
- Explore standard combinators for operating on lists
- Produce definitions of algebraic data types and apply recursion to define functions that traverse such types
- Apply formal methods to prove properties of functional programs
- Justify why a program uses common standard monads (including IO and Maybe)
