## Haskell Platform ##
To run Haskell programs on your computer, you will need to download the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).

After downloading, go to PowerShell and type `ghci`. It should display the GHCi version, and on pressing enter, `Prelude>`.

To run the source code file `factorial.hs`, type in `:load factorial.hs` in front of `Prelude>`. Hopefully it compiles without errors!
